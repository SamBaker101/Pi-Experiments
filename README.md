# Pi-Experiments
I recently got a Raspberry Pi 4 which I am planning to use for a robotics project in the future. I have created this repository to house a number of smaller projects I will be doing with the Raspberry Pi before I begin using it for robotics. My goal here is to familiarize myself with the Pi's hardware and use. I will be focusing on interfacing with the GPIOs, generating and controlling PWM signals and handling interrupts.

At this point I am using C with the WiringPi library though this may change in future

# Projects
1 - Blinky - Blink an LED attached to a GPIO pin \n
2 - Pressy - have an LED turn on when a button is pressed
